export const ABOUT_ME =
  `I'm a front-end developer specialized in delivering high-performance, scalable applications centered on user experience. My work focuses on performance, accessibility, SEO, and best development practices — prioritizing clean code, clear documentation, and smooth back-end integration. Each project is an opportunity to merge creativity, strategy, and technology to create real impact.

I currently work as a Web Developer at Metadados, where I was responsible for the complete development of the company’s institutional website. I used Astro, React.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Strapi, achieving a score of 100 in SEO and nearly 100% in accessibility on Lighthouse. I boosted performance by over 40 points on Google PageSpeed and contributed to increased organic traffic and domain authority, as validated by metrics from tools like SEMrush, Ahrefs, and Google Search Console.

My main stack includes:
Frontend: React.js, Next.js, Astro, TypeScript, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, HTML5, CSS3
Back-end: Node.js, Express.js, PHP, Laravel
Database: PostgreSQL (and PLSQL), MySQL Workbench, MySQL, MongoDB
DevOps/Deployment: Docker, Azure DevOps, Vercel, Railway, Nginx
Integrations: REST APIs, CMS (WordPress, Strapi), Webhooks, Analytics, Hubspot, Clarity
Tools: Git, GitHub, Postman, Figma, Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights

I have solid experience with RESTful API integration, CI/CD pipelines, version control, and scalable deployments. I’ve also worked on maintaining legacy systems built with Laravel and MySQL, as well as leading restructures toward modern stacks focused on scalability and performance.

Beyond my professional work, I’m the founder and content creator of Alegoria dos Computeiros, an independent project where I share insights, digital culture, and development topics with a personal touch.

I was also awarded at MOCITEC 2022 for my thesis — an interactive platform and visual novel about mental health titled Asta vs. The Demons, combining narrative, art, and technology to raise social awareness.

My journey began early: during technical school, I explored programming languages, participated in seminars, and immersed myself in different areas of technology. I’m currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development (GPA: 9.06), with a continuous focus on technical improvement, interface architecture, and collaboration in agile environments.

I'm looking for opportunities where I can contribute with practical solutions, solid technical decisions, and deliveries that positively impact users and the final product.`.trim();
