export const ABOUT_ME =
  `I'm a front-end developer focused on performance, accessibility, and SEO, building scalable, user-centric applications. I prioritize clean code and seamless integrations.

At Metadados, I developed the institutional website using Astro, React.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, and Strapi. I achieved 100 in SEO and nearly 100% in accessibility on Lighthouse, and optimized performance by over 40 points on Google PageSpeed, boosting organic traffic and domain authority.

My core stack includes:

Frontend: React.js, Next.js, Astro, TypeScript, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS.
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, PHP, Laravel.
Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB.
DevOps/Deploy: Docker, Azure DevOps, Vercel.
I have solid experience integrating RESTful APIs, CI/CD pipelines, version control, and scalable deployments, as well as restructuring legacy systems.

Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development (GPA: 9.06), constantly seeking to improve my technical skills and interface architecture to deliver solutions that positively impact users and products.`.trim();
